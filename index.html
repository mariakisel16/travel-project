          <h2>READY. SET. GEORGIA.</h2>
          <p>
            As we’ve all imagined the places and people we want to see, our love
            for exploration has become clear. Georgia puts it all within reach,
            and there is no one Georgia experience. It’s something you find on a
            waterfall hike near Helen in the Georgia mountains or by relaxing on
            a beach on St. Simons Island off the Georgia coast. Or, in front of
            a mural in Atlanta, or a bowl of shrimp and grits in Savannah. It’s
            the Georgia you go out and live. These are your moments waiting to
            happen. So, get Ready. Set. Georgia.
